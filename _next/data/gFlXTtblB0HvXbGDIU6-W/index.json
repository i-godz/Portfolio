To streamline the process of ticket purchasing and event management, a web application and an admin panel have been developed by me. The web application enables users to purchase tickets for events, while the admin panel empowers the museum staff to manage the events and orders more efficiently.\n\n## Features:\nThe web application provides users with a user-friendly interface that facilitates easy ticket purchasing. It consists of the following features:\n\nEvent Listing: The events of the museum are listed on the home page, along with their details such as date, time, price and types of visitors.\n\nTicket Purchase: Users can purchase tickets for different types of people, such as old people, adults, and children, for each event by clicking on the \"add visitor\" button. The tickets can be added and removed from the cart as per the user's requirements.\n\nOrder Details: After adding tickets to the cart, users are required to enter their order details on the order details page.\n\nPayment: Upon submitting the order details, users are asked to enter their payment information. After successful payment submission, the tickets are booked.\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nThe Ben Gurion Museum web application and admin panel provide an efficient way to manage the events and orders. The web application simplifies the ticket purchasing process for users, while the admin panel empowers museum staff to manage the events and orders more efficiently.

Introduction\n\nThis web application is for selling and buying vehicle parts. The main objective of the project was to provide a platform for users to easily buy and sell vehicle parts, whether they were looking for a specific part or the suppliers wanting to sell parts.\n\n## II. Key challenges\n\nOne of the main challenges I faced while building this project was that it had to be made from right to left and the main language was Hebrew, which was a little difficult for me to adapt to as I am used to building from left to right. However, I was able to overcome this challenge by taking the time to familiarize myself with the right-to-left layout and making sure that all of the elements on the page were correctly aligned.\n\n## III. Solutions implemented\n\nTo address the challenge of building the application from right to left, I took the following steps:\n\n- I familiarized myself with the right-to-left layout by researching best practices and reviewing examples of other right-to-left websites.\n\n- I made sure to align all of the elements on the page correctly, including text, images, and buttons.\n\n- I tested the application on different devices and browsers to ensure that it was displaying correctly for all users.\n\n## IV. Results\n\nAs a result of the solutions I implemented, the web application was successful in achieving its main objective of providing a platform for users to easily buy and sell vehicle parts. Some of the specific results we saw included:\n\n- Increased user engagement: The number of users visiting the website and using the application increased significantly after its launch.\n\n- Improved user experience: Feedback from users indicated that they found the application easy to use and navigate, thanks to the well-designed layout and intuitive interface.\n\n- Increased website traffic: The website saw a significant increase in traffic after the launch of the application, as more users became aware of the platform and began using it.\n\n## V. Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, building the web application for selling and buying vehicle parts presented some challenges, including the need to adapt to a right-to-left layout and Hebrew language.\nHowever, by researching best practices and carefully aligning all of the elements on the page, I was able to successfully overcome these challenges and deliver a high-quality application that met the needs of the users. \n\nThe results of the project speak for themselves, with increased user engagement, improved user experience, and increased website traffic. In the future, I will consider these lessons learned and apply them to similar projects to ensure their success.","screenshots":[{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"awy0uwqcdbbl"}},"id":"2ippKU2JpD4BLUUQXHfvdv","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2023-04-07T18:53:45.825Z","updatedAt":"2023-04-07T18:57:56.041Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"description":"Collection One","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/awy0uwqcdbbl/2ippKU2JpD4BLUUQXHfvdv/0411aba90b2e5d8af7caaf7db9950df0/jpeg.jpg","details":{"size":624988,"image":{"width":2000,"height":2300}},"fileName":"jpeg.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"awy0uwqcdbbl"}},"id":"248ELJE3M1IafMXZiAzCde","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2023-04-07T20:23:01.854Z","updatedAt":"2023-04-07T20:23:01.854Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"description":"Search Screen","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/awy0uwqcdbbl/248ELJE3M1IafMXZiAzCde/0f96cf77b3188fd118aa3eeab5d9b8ed/search-screen.jpg","details":{"size":416036,"image":{"width":2000,"height":2300}},"fileName":"search-screen.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"awy0uwqcdbbl"}},"id":"14mawW4gYMzfWLQgbqwChW","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2023-04-07T20:35:59.902Z","updatedAt":"2023-04-07T20:35:59.902Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"description":"Login and Register Screen","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/awy0uwqcdbbl/14mawW4gYMzfWLQgbqwChW/2c08629f80864f898aef9dc5acc69d50/login-register.jpg","details":{"size":458189,"image":{"width":2000,"height":2300}},"fileName":"login-register.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"awy0uwqcdbbl"}},"id":"4lW1oGKBAOYm6pATSBxhck","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2023-04-07T22:08:23.050Z","updatedAt":"2023-04-07T22:08:23.050Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"description":"Subscriber and Supplier Page","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/awy0uwqcdbbl/4lW1oGKBAOYm6pATSBxhck/92df56db7aed24a7d511971f974c4eb3/sub-sup.jpg","details":{"size":442691,"image":{"width":2000,"height":2300}},"fileName":"sub-sup.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"awy0uwqcdbbl"}},"id":"2FLE59zfjEsm4kanelnLAm","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2023-04-07T22:08:53.360Z","updatedAt":"2023-04-07T22:08:53.360Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"description":"Contact Page, Forgot Page and Subscription Modal","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/awy0uwqcdbbl/2FLE59zfjEsm4kanelnLAm/e95c72766ae242e6c5631837a562556c/contact-forgot-sub-modal.jpg","details":{"size":398327,"image":{"width":2000,"height":2300}},"fileName":"contact-forgot-sub-modal.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}]}},{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"awy0uwqcdbbl"}},"id":"6QAK7Mo1skLDwqZOxJA0eo","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2023-03-03T15:18:14.885Z","updatedAt":"2023-04-20T10:44:54.927Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":6,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"projects"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"slug":"micado","name":"Micado","featureImg":{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"awy0uwqcdbbl"}},"id":"4esuIBudPybqro898G2UBI","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2023-03-03T15:17:45.080Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-03T15:17:45.080Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"feature-img","description":"feature-img","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/awy0uwqcdbbl/4esuIBudPybqro898G2UBI/4d7f3cb092119af87eae93b2ed456c55/feature-img.png","details":{"size":631602,"image":{"width":1920,"height":1080}},"fileName":"feature-img.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"category":"Web Application","tech":"NextJS -
